# RAG EndToEnd Document QA

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries. It provides a practical example of combining dense retrieval with generative large language models to build intelligent, context-aware QA systems.

## Features

- Load and encode knowledge base documents using FAISS + DPR
- Perform dense retrieval using a question encoder
- Generate context-aware answers using a generative model (e.g., BART or similar)
- Fully implemented in Python with Hugging Face libraries
- Modular code for easy customization and experimentation

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAG_EndToEnd_Document_QA.git
cd RAG_EndToEnd_Document_QA
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
