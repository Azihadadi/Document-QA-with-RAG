# 🧠 Document QA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for implementing a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using Hugging Face's `transformers` and `datasets` libraries. It provides a practical example of combining dense retrieval with generative large language models to build intelligent, context-aware QA systems.

## 📌 Features

- Load and encode knowledge base documents using FAISS + DPR
- Perform dense retrieval using a question encoder
- Generate context-aware answers using a generative model (e.g., BART or similar)
- Fully implemented in Python with Hugging Face libraries
- Modular code for easy customization and experimentation

## 📁 File

- `Document_QA_with_RAG.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the complete RAG pipeline, from indexing documents to generating answers.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Document_QA_with_RAG.git
